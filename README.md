# Who?
Some call me Rick. But most call me Richard.

# What?
After searching the internet for five seconds, I realized there is NO doge recognition software whatsoever. My goal is to create a neural network capable of recognizing doge memes to address this gross injustice.

# When?
I'm not really an expert on machine learning so this could take a while.

# Why?
I have no idea.

# How?
Tensorflow!
